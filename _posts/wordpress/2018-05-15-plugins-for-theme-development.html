						<h2>Log Deprecated Notices</h2>
						<p>This plugin logs the usage of deprecated files, functions, and function arguments. It identifies where the deprecated functionality is being used and offers the alternative if available.</p>
						 <p>This is a plugin for developers. WP_DEBUG is not needed, though its general usage is strongly recommended. Deprecated notices normally exposed by WP_DEBUG will be logged instead.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Monster Widget</h2>
						<p>The Monster widget consolidates all 13 core widgets into a single widget enabling theme developers to create multiple instances with ease. It has been created to save time during theme development and review by minimizing the steps needed to populate a sidebar with widgets. The Monster widget is not designed for use in production.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Show Current Template</h2>
						<p>A WordPress plugin which shows the current template file name, the current theme name and included template files’ name in the tool bar.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Theme Check</h2>
						<p>The theme check plugin is an easy way to test your theme and make sure it’s up to spec with the latest theme review standards. With it, you can run all the same automated testing tools on your theme that WordPress.org uses for theme submissions.</p>
						<p>The tests are run through a simple admin menu and all results are displayed at once. This is very handy for theme developers, or anybody looking to make sure that their theme supports the latest WordPress theme standards and practices.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>WP-Sweep</h2>
						<p>This plugin cleans up:</p>
						<ul>

							<li>Deleted comments</li>
							<li>Unapproved comments</li>
							<li>Spammed comments</li>
							<li>Deleted comments</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Debug Bar</h2>
						<p>Adds a debug menu to the admin bar that shows query, cache, and other helpful debugging information.</p>
						<p>When WP_DEBUG is enabled it also tracks PHP Warnings and Notices to make them easier to find.</p>
						<p>When SAVEQUERIES is enabled the mysql queries are tracked and displayed.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Demo Data Creator</h2>
						<p>DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN ON A PRODUCTION SITE, OR ON A SITE WHERE YOU NEED TO KEEP THE DATA.</p>
						<p>When deleting demo data your ENTIRE WordPress database will be reset, deleting ALL your posts, pages, comments and users. ONLY USE THIS PLUGIN ON A SITE WHERE YOU KNOW THE DATABASE CAN BE WIPED.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Kirki</h2>
						<p>Using Kirki theme developers can create rich experiences for the WordPress Customizer using best coding practices.</p>
						<p>Included are more than 30 custom control types ranging from simple sliders to complex typography controls with Google-Fonts integration, automatic CSS generation, postMessage scripts automatically generated, tooltips and a lot of extras that make developing themes a lot faster for developers and meaningful for users.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Regenerate Thumbnails</h2>
						<p>Regenerate Thumbnails allows you to regenerate all thumbnail sizes for one or more images that have been uploaded to your Media Library.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Use Google Libraries</h2>
						<p>A number of the javascript libraries distributed with WordPress are also hosted on Google’s AJAX Libraries API.</p>
						<p>This plugin allows your WordPress site to use the content distribution network side of Google’s AJAX Library API, rather than serving these files from your WordPress install directly.</p>
